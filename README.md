Part time job app

## Motivation
The current Corona Virus pandemy has made even more difficult than before to find a steady job. As global economy has become more turbulent, job security is now a myth. Still there is always value in experience and skills. And as long as you are deliberate enough, you can find the right opportunities to continue your business.

Surprisingly enough, there are sufficient requirements for each of these talents.  

Our current situation requires this because it is easier to hire them on a contractual basis than to hire them full time, train them and enter into a long-term relationship. Especially when you're not sure you can afford it forever.

Flexible jobs are the golden opportunities for growth in any industry.
